    <Description>
      The subject lives by his own exertion, will have an independent spirit and will have two wives or one married and another illegal.
      If the Lagnadhipati is well disposed in Lagna, the person becomes famous in his own community and country.
      The reader must note that the combination is of general application. The exact nature of the results should be interpreted by taking into account the strength, weakness and other factors attendant upon the house lord. If Lagnadhipati is in Lagna and aspected by evil planets, the results produced will be quite different from those which he would have produced by being aspected by benefics. The same rules apply to all Bhavas which should be borne in mind by every reader.

      The position of the 2nd lord in a constellation which does not happen to be the 3rd, 5th and 7th from Janma Nakshatra is highly desirable, especially
      if he is otherwise fortified, i.e., joined with or aspected by benefics. The exaltation of the 2nd lord of his disposition in Lagna, the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th or 10th,
      will fortify him to the extent of making him a yogakaraka. The native will be enabled to earn considerable fortune through business or other occupations consistent with the nature of the 2nd lord and 2nd house. Depending upon the nature of the aspects cast on the 2nd lord by malefic planets, the native will sustain losses. An affliction to the 2nd lord may also express itself in the shape of the subject not getting nutritious and delicious food, or his family and children suffering from constant diseases, or want of cordial relations between the native and his life-partner.
